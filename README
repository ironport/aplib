This directory contains the "aplib" python package.  It contains a collection
of random, generic modules.  The general criteria for a module being included
here is that it is too small to justify tracking it as a separate component,
and it is shared between different groups/products.

These modules were developed at IronPort Systems and have been provided by
Cisco Systems under an MIT license.
