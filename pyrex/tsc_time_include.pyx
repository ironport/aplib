# This include file makes it possible to directly access the C functions from
# the tsc_time module.  To use it, you need to put this at the top of your
# Pyrex file:
#
#     cimport libc
#     include "python.pxi"
#     include "tsc_time_include.pyx"
#
# This will also implicitly cimport the tsc_time module so that you can have
# direct access to the type objects.  This allows you to do something like this:
#
#     cdef tsc_time.TSC t
#     t = now_tsc()
#     print t.tsc
#
# This will allow direct C access to the member variables of the Time objects.
